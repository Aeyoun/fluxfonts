Dependencies

Fedora:
* systemd-devel

Debian/Ubuntu:
* systemd-dev


Building

1. make


Installing

1. make install [install-daemon] [--prefix=/usr/local]

Linux installs a systemd service file for running the daemon with
`install-daemon` and macOS installs a launchd service file. FreeBSD
will need to configure a service or cron to run the daemon on boot.
Windows is unsupported.


Notes for package  distributors

The program service does not need to run as the root user. Create the
required directories as part of the installation package, and the
fluxfontd daemon should only require read permissions for those
directories. This is the preferred way to run fluxfontd.
