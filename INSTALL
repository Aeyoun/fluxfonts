Installation notes


Checksums for releases can be obtained from the projectâ€™s
web site at https://www.aeyoun.priv.no/p/fluxfonts/intro.html

To install to the default locations, run `make install-all`.
You can also set a custom directory prefix by running e.g.
`make prefix=/opt install-all`. `install-all` include system daemons
and documentation. `install`, however, does not.

The program should be run as a system daemon with root permissions
Daemons to run the program are configured automatically provided
they can be detected. OS X (launchd), Ubuntu (upstart), systemd, and
System V init (Debian) are supported. Running `make install-launchd`,
`make install-upstart`, `make install-systemd`, or
`make install-sysvinit` can be used to reconfigure this again.

Other daemon managers such as initng, and cron must be configured
manually.


The program does not need to run as the root user. Create the required
directories (run it once as root to create the approperiate for your
distribution). The program will run without problems as a daemon user
with write permissions to these directories. This should be done by
package maintainers to avoid any potential security issues related to
running the program under the root user.
