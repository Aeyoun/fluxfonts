Installation notes


Checksums for releases can be obtained from the projectâ€™s
web site at https://www.aeyoun.priv.no/p/fluxfonts/intro.html

To install to the default locations, run `make install-all`.
You can also set a custom directory prefix by running e.g.
`make prefix=/opt install-all`. `install-all` include system daemons
and documentation. `install`, however, does not.

The program should be run as a system daemon with root permissions
Daemons to run the program are configured automatically provided
they can be detected. OS X (launchd), Ubuntu (upstart), and System
V init (Debian) are supported. Running `make install-launchd`,
`make install-upstart`, or `make install-sysvinit` can be used to
reconfigure this again.

Other daemon managers such as initng, and cron must be configured
manually.
